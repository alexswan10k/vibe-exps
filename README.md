# Vibe Experiments

A collection of interactive web-based experiments, games, and tools built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These have been generated with Cline and "Grok code fast", iteratively (sometimes 30-50 iterations, so not 1 shot). I also have the added bonus of 15 years of dev experience to debug it where it goes off the rails, but to the most part these tools show a lot of promise for basic prototyping.
